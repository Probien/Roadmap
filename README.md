## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?
First, I had no idea how to structure the project, I come from java and have always used the MVC pattern to build APIs, then I decided to learn another type of desing so I create this project with domain based approach [(DDD)](https://airbrake.io/blog/software-design/domain-driven-design) (Recomendations are welcome).
